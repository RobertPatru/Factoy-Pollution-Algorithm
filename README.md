A company has developed a filter that reduces the pollutant emissions released into the atmosphere by 50%. Installing these filters has become mandatory for all factories that have greater than 0 emission level.

Each installed filter reduces the emissions by 50%.
Eg: Factory emission = 100
with 1 filter = 50
with 2 filters = 25
with 3 filter = 12.5

The user can introduce an array (of N lenght) of integers whch represent the emissions of each factory of a company. The application will reduce the overall emission by at least 50% using the least amount of filters possible.
